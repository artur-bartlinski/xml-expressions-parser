#IMPORTANT

/app/storage/xml/examples - XML examples I used for testing
/app/storage/xml/schema/expressions.xsd - XSD validation schema I use in app
/app/database/database.sql - this SQL file needs to be imported to your database
/config.php - you need to set up your local config here

Run 'composer install' command from app root directory.

If app is installed then and set up on your local server then enter for example:

http://localhost/expressions

in your web browser and you may import XML file there.
More routes setup you find in:

/app/routes.php

#ENJOY!
